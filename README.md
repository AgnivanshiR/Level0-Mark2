# Quiz Game

This is a simple quiz game that asks the user a series of questions and keeps track of their score.
## How to play the game

The game will ask the user a series of questions and display the score after each question. The user can enter their answer using the keyboard. If the answer is correct, the score will be incremented by 1. If the answer is incorrect, the score will be decremented by 1. The game will continue until all the questions have been answered.

## Customizing the game

You can customize the game by modifying the `questions` array in the `index.js` file. Each element of the array should be an object with a `question` and an `answer` property, representing the question and the correct answer, respectively.
